/**
 * \file gt_base.h
 *
 * \brief GuardTime client SDK, public header file for base functions.
 *
 * This module offers the basic functions to create, encode, decode and
 * otherwise process the timestamps, but does not address issues like
 * network transport or embedding timestamps into specific document formats.
 *
 * The three main functions are:
 * - creating a timestamp (the resulting PKI-signed timestamp
 * can be verified using the GuardTime public key certificate);
 * - extending a timestamp (the resulting hash-linked timestamp
 * can be verified independently from GuardTime for unlimited time);
 * - verifying a timestamp.
 *
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 *
 * The cryptographic functions in this SDK rely on OpenSSL. The use of
 * the OpenSSL code is covered by the license available online from
 * <a href="http://www.openssl.org/source/license.html">www.openssl.org/source/license.html</a>
 * and also enclosed in the file \c license.openssl.txt.
 *
 * Multi-platform source code for OpenSSL can be downloaded from
 * <a href="http://www.openssl.org/">www.openssl.org</a>.
 * This version of the SDK has been tested with OpenSSL 0.9.8g.
 *
 * <b>Linux</b>
 *
 * Although it's not difficult to compile OpenSSL on Linux, most distributions
 * also provide prebuilt binaries through their normal package management
 * facilities. When installing a prebuilt package, make sure you pick a
 * "developer" version, otherwise you may only get the tools and utilities,
 * but no libraries or headers.
 *
 * To compile a program that uses the GuardTime base API, use a command along
 * the lines of
 * \code
 *    gcc example.c -o example -I/usr/local/gt/include \
 *    -L/usr/local/gt/lib -L/usr/local/ssl/lib \
 *    -lgtbase -lcrypto -lrt
 * \endcode
 * (either with the backslashes or all on a single line) replacing
 * \c /usr/local/gt and \c /usr/local/ssl with
 * the directories where you unpacked the GuardTime and OpenSSL libraries.
 *
 * <b>Windows</b>
 *
 * OpenSSL can be complied on Windows, but it's easier to use the prebuilt
 * binaries distributed with the SDK.
 *
 * To compile a program that uses the GuardTime base API, use a command along
 * the lines of
 * \code
 *    cl.exe /MT example.c /I C:\gt\include
 *    /link /libpath:C:\gt\lib /libpath:C:\openssl\lib
 *    libgtbaseMT.lib libeay32MT.lib
 *    wsock32.lib wldap32.lib winmm.lib user32.lib gdi32.lib advapi32.lib
 * \endcode
 * (all on a single line) replacing
 * \c C:\\gt and \c C:\\openssl with
 * the directories where you unpacked the GuardTime and OpenSSL libraries.
 *
 * When compiling, keep in mind that mixing code compiled with different
 * \c /Mxx settings is dangerous. It's best to always use the
 * GuardTime and OpenSSL libraries that match the \c /Mxx
 * setting you specified for compiling your own source code.
